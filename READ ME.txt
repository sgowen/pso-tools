Change Log @Ver 1.2 :

1. Added tabs for multiple functions

2. Increased the size of the drop charts box, as it was too small to read before.

3. Added the ability to stop the music(at the last track, the button will change to read "STOP"; if clicked, the music will stop and the button will change back to "Track>>"

4. Added a "Mag Feeding Chart" tab with a drop menu containing every single possible mag attainable (excluding the special mags). After making a selection, pressing the button will bring up the appropriate feeding chart for the mag.

5. Added a "Hot Chicks" tab. I was bored and figured an extra bonus tab would be nice! Every picture is clickable for extra details.

6. Added tooltip contexts for every tab.

7. Added an "About" tab. Now that this project is becoming rather large and somewhat useful, it seemed like a good idea to include some information about myself just in case 	somebody wants to support me with a donation ;)

8. Lastly, all of the contents of the frame are placed dynamically, which means that the components such as buttons and text fields are all proportional to each other. Before I had placed the components at fixed locations, making it hard to add content. Now, further expansions to this software should not take as long.

Simple Instructions:
	
If you want to be able to use the shortcut (that has the cool icon), the folder must be placed in "C:\". If you know how to set up shortcuts and icons on your own, the icon file is provided just for that. Enjoy!
